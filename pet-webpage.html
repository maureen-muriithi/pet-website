    <h2><strong> Interesting Facts About Parrots!</strong></h2>
    <p>
      When there are over 350 species in one order, the Psittaciformes, it's
      safe to assume that some things will stand out. With parrots, this is
      exactly the case. Much of it is due to the many environments in which they
      live. We're talking about tropical rainforests, savannas, and shrubland,
      among other things.

      Birds are the fourth most popular pet in the United States, after dogs,
      cats, and fish. In the United States, an estimated 14 million birds, many
      of them parrots, live in captivity. And it's easy to see why: these avian
      characters are impossible to ignore, with their fascinating colors,
      acrobatic actions, and frequently goofy personalities.

      Pet parrots can be wonderful, if demanding, companions, but they can also
      present some surprising issues for those who are used to fluffy mammalian
      companions. Long-lived, clever, and extremely social birds require extra
      attention and stimulation, otherwise they may develop negative habits and
      become bored and stressed to the point of plucking their own feathers.
